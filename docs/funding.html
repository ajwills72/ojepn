<h3>Plymouth University bursaries</h3>
<p>The Cognition Institute, part of <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/">Plymouth University</a>, U.K., has sponsored 10 full bursaries for postgrads and post-docs at the university, to cover the full Article Processing Charge at OJEPN. The bursaries may also extend to staff members of the university if they do not have access to other funds. These bursaries are administered by OJEPN on behalf of the university. They are allocated at point of paper acceptance, on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
