# OJEPN checklist
_This checklist is currently under development_.

Sorry, your paper has been rejected for the following reasons. 
If you can address these points, we would welcome a resubmission.

## [ ] Analysis not reproducible

Either you have not committed to making your raw data available on publication of this manuscript (nor stated why this is not possible e.g. ethical reasons), or there is insufficient detail of your analysis pipeline to ensure reproducibility (consider making your analysis script publicly available).

## [ ] Statistical power not demonstrated

At least one of the experiments reported in your manuscript should demonstrably have statistical power of at least 80%.
If you are not able to demonstrate this, consider resubmitting as an _Early Report_.

## [ ] Concluding from a null in NHST

You have made a claim on the basis of the absence of an effect, but have used null-hypothesis significance testing to suport this claim. This is a fallacy. Use, for example, Bayesian analysis to show you have evidence of absence, rather than just absence of evidence.

## [ ] Manuscript too long

OJEPN has a word limit of 4000 words; you have substantially exceeded this limit.
